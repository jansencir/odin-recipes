        <h2>What is Garlic Fried Rice?</h2>
        <p>I'm not sure about other cultures, but it's something we make a lot in Filipino cultures. Garlic fried rice is a super simple recipe to add a bit of flavor to your dish without taking away from the main entree(s).</p>
        <p>Unlike other fried rice dishes, like shrimp fried rice, garlic fried rice is not meant to be eaten alone (I mean you can but it would be kinda weird).</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Rice, 2 cups (cooked & frozen overnight)</li>
                <li>Garlic, 6 cloves (roughly chopped)</li>
                <li>Cooking Oil, 2 tbsp (any neutral oil will do)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place pan on cooktop and set corresponding burner to medium high heat</li>
                <li>Pour cooking oil in pan and let heat up</li>
                <li>Once oil is hot, place chopped garlic in pan and stir constantly</li>
                <li>When garlic turns golden brown, place rice in pan and toss (coat every grain of rice in the garlic-flavored oil.</li>
                <li>Serve rice in a plate and enjoy</li>
            </ol>
